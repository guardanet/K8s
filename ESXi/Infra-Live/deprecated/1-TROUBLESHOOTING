u18-tmpl.ova: is a VM I installed from ISO and then dumped it into OVA using ovftool


1. Using tf provider
  a. ovf source = my ova | standard ubuntu image OVA locally saved | standard ubuntu image pulled from the Internet
  b. with or without metadata
  c. always with userData
  d. NIC type unset or set to vmxnet3

  RESULT: In ALL cases new VM is deployed but no network

  e. deployed as a vm clone
  RESULT: process hangs at the begining and VM is never created

  f. my OVA with userdata
  RESULT: WORKS :)

3. Using the webUI
  a. using the generic Ubuntu OVA and changing options to change the name as well as add the SSH key
  RESULT: deploys but no network

  b. deployed from the webUI using the generic Ubuntu OVA without customizations
  RESULT: deploys but no network

  c. deployed my OVA that I created from an exisiting VM
  RESULT: WORKS

TO Check
where cloud init stores logs and meta/user/vendor data and see what it looks like an VM deployed from ISO
